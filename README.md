# __*Responsive Portfolio*__

## __Detials About This Assignment__
The purpose of this homework assignment was to get a better understanding and grip with modifying CSS frameworks to work with a custom design. As well as modifying the CSS, we had to make our custom css styles be responsive along with the rest of the site. So I ended up using multiple different media queries to achive the look and function that I was aiming towards. I also used semantic HTML tags to conform to the industry standard.

- [ ] I still need to add images and projects to the site, that will come at a later date.
- [ ] I am also going to rework the responsiveness of the media queries.
